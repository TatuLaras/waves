# waves - A simple C library for modular FM synthesis

## Installation
Copy the header files `include/waves.h` and `include/vec.h` into your include directory.
Copy the source file `src/waves.c` into your source directory.

## Building the example
There is a simple example of using this library with `miniaudio.h` which can be compiled using `make example`.
The executable will be in `build/example`.

## Usage
(TBD) Will be added as the library evolves a bit futher to avoid duplicated work.
